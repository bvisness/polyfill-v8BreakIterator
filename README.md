This repository contains a polyfill for the non-standard and deprecated `Intl.v8BreakIterator` API in the browser, which was superseded by `Intl.Segmenter.`

**THIS POLYFILL IS VERY SIMPLE AND DOES NOT SUPPORT ALL FEATURES OF THE ORIGINAL.** It was thrown together in an afternoon. It will likely not work for many use cases, and you should probably use the standard API anyway.
